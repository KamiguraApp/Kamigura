## What is Kamigura

**Kamigura** (紙倉, *paper warehouse*) is a third-party Android app for reading manga and light novels from a [Kavita](https://www.kavitareader.com/) server.

It is especially focused on people who digitize their own physical books and want a comfortable native reading experience on tablets and phones.

> Status: **v0.15 (early)**. Usable, but still evolving.

## Highlights

Several Kavita clients already exist. Kamigura focuses on **tablet/phone parity** and **reading ergonomics for self-scanned books**.

- **Spread-pair correction**
  When covers, title pages, or wide illustrations shift a spread by one page, edge long press or the reader menu provides **Shift +1 / -1** controls to recover the intended pairing.

- **Smart Invert**
  The reader can switch between **Off / Smart / Always**. Smart Invert flips mostly-white text pages for night reading while leaving illustrations and color pages untouched.
  - The "Smart" detection threshold (percentage of white) is **adjustable in the settings**

- **Search**
  The Home Search tab searches Series / Persons / Genres / Tags / Collections / Reading Lists / Chapters and lets you jump from authors or metadata to filtered series grids.

## Other features

- Multiple Kavita server profiles
- Reading progress sync and mark-as-read on completion
- Offline reading
- Reader page prefetch
- Admin-only Scan Library / metadata refresh actions
- Navigation rail on tablets and bottom navigation on phones

## For Developers

Kamigura is written in Kotlin 2.x with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 / Material 3 Expressive components. Networking is handled with Retrofit and kotlinx.serialization, while cover and reader-page images are loaded with Coil.

Kavita integration is intentionally centralized around `app/src/main/java/li/mof/kamigura/KavitaApi.kt`. UI layers should consume Kamigura models and repositories rather than constructing Kavita calls directly.

Design notes and implementation scratchpads live under `docs/`. They are internal working notes and may be git-ignored, stale, or written for local development rather than public API documentation. For public discussion, bug reports, and feature requests, please use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/KamiguraApp/Kamigura/issues).
